# Hello 👋

## I'm Joyce Silva

After nearly a decade working as a Quality Manager Nurse in the healthcare industry, I’m now transitioning into the **QA (Quality Assurance)** field. I bring a strong background in process auditing, compliance, and operational quality, now applied to software development and testing.

I completed the QA Bootcamp at [TripleTen Brazil](https://tripleten.com/br), where I worked on real-world projects involving **test case creation, manual testing, API testing with Postman, bug tracking with Jira, and automation with Python and Pytest**.

Currently, I’m focused on continuous learning, participating in projects, contributing to digital product quality, and growing my professional presence in the tech industry.
